		
First part:
	Some visualizations:


Than the 4 models:
	1 - KNN
	2 - SVM
	3 - RF
	4 - Logistic Regression
	( 2 slides each )
	 try to cover:
	 	- overfitting problem
	 	- how accuracy changes when you change relevant parameters

Conclussions:
	Which algorithm seems to work best on these data? What did you observe in terms of overfitting behaviour?
